Hello, fellow explorer! I am Yiheng "Terry" Li, and I invite you on a journey through the digital landscape of my life and work. 🚀

Dive into the technical depths with me as I share my story. I stand today as a a little bit seasoned deep learning research scientist, my quest driven by the desire to unravel the intricate mysteries of the human mind and body. I have honed my skills in the exciting field of Biomedical Informatics, earning my MSc from the prestigious Stanford University. 🎓 You can find the milestones and technical achievements of my academic and professional journey in my [Resume](/resume/).

But life isn't all about work, right? When I'm not crunching numbers or developing algorithms, you'll find me strumming my guitar 🎸, belting out a tune 🎤, or exploring the world one city at a time 🌍. And if you're up for a challenge, we can always hit the badminton court 🏸!

Welcome to my blog, a digital space where I delve into the intricacies of deep learning, share my latest research findings, and explore the fascinating world of Biomedical Informatics. Whether you're a fellow scientist, a tech enthusiast, or simply curious, I hope you'll find something here to pique your interest. Let's embark on this technical adventure together!

I know some of you are curious about the Biomedical Informatics program at Stanford. 🎓 It's a fascinating journey that dives deep into the intersection of medicine and information technology. If you're interested in the nitty-gritty details, you can check out the [program overview](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html) and the [curriculum](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi/biomedical-informatics-students/curriculum.html) to get a feel for what you'll be learning. 📚💻

The program is packed with exciting projects that challenge you to apply your knowledge in real-world scenarios. 🌍💡 If you're wondering about the project application process or have any other questions, don't hesitate to reach out to me.

# How I created this website

Crafting this digital realm of mine, I channeled the power of the robust static website builder, "Hugo". This nifty tool played a key role, transforming abstract code into the sturdy framework of my site. To drape it with an eye-catching attire, I turned to the artfully designed template "PaperMod". 🎨 This dynamic duo paved the way for the web pages you see before you.

My digital space now lives and breathes on the versatile platform of GitHub pages. Prior to this, I used to dance with Hexo and styled my moves with the NexT theme. 💃🕺But with change being the only constant, I moved on to explore new horizons.

Now, I am eager to share the journey of my website's creation. Look forward to a detailed blog post 📝that will guide you to navigate these digital waters, empowering you to build and host your own vibrant blogs with ease. 🚀 Because, after all, sharing knowledge is the best way to grow together! 💡
