## BIOMEDIN 273B: [Deep Learning in Genomics and Biomedicine](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&q=BIOMEDIN%20273B:%20Deep%20Learning%20in%20Genomics%20and%20Biomedicine&academicYear=20162017)

**Time:** 2020 fall

**Description:** This course was taught by professor Anshul Kundaje and James Zou. In the course, we formed groups and were given data and directions for course projects. Our group had 4 people, with data from an HT-recruit RNA-seq study, we wanted to build models to identify repression effect of protein tiles and Pfam proteins. 

**Responsibility:** I was responsible for building coding pipeline for data loading, visualization of figures, model tuning and prediction analysis, finalizing the presentations and final report. 

**Code:** The code of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/o-fadil/cs273b).

**Report:** final report of the project is recorded below.

## CS 330: [Deep Multi-Task and Meta Learning](https://cs330.stanford.edu/)

**Time:** 2020 fall

**Description:** This course was taught by professor Chelsea Finn, and was focus on meta-learning and multi-task learning subjects, especially in reinforced-learning topics. The course project is freely selected topic/dat with course related research ideas.

**Project Overview:** I used head impact signal data from multiple sources/sport type/datasets, which maximum principal strain is a important prediction target. By implementing meta-learning approaches to do the prediction, I hoped to let the models to be adaptive for multiple datasets. Data distribution shifting as well as long-tailed distribution datasets are very common in medical field (e.g. institutional differences of medical images, rare disease, patient cohort changes)

**Code:** This project is still under development. I want to try some new ideas, so the code is not organized yet.

**Report:** final report of the project is recorded below.

## CS 230: [Deep Learning](https://cs230.stanford.edu/)

**Time:** 2019 winter

**Description:** Taught by the [CS230 teaching team](https://cs230.stanford.edu/#course-staff) led by Andrew Ng, focused on general foundations of deep learning. Open topic project.

**Poster/Project Overview:** Poster of the project can be accessed through this [link](http://cs230.stanford.edu/projects_winter_2020/posters/32058965.pdf).

**Report:** Final report of the project can be accessed through this [link](http://cs230.stanford.edu/projects_winter_2020/reports/32058965.pdf).

## CS 229: [Machine Learning](http://cs229.stanford.edu/)

**Time:** 2020 spring

**Description:** Taught by professor Tengyu Ma, Andrew Ng and Chris RÃ©. The "most famous" course in Stanford. Open topic project.

**Poster/Project Overview:** Poster of the project can be accessed through this [link](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2020spr/poster/Zhan_Li.pdf).

**Report:** Final report of the project can be accessed through this [link](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2020spr/report/Zhan_Li.pdf).

## BIOMEDIN 260: [Computational Methods for Biomedical Image Analysis and Interpretation](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&q=BIOMEDIN 260: Computational Methods for Biomedical Image Analysis and Interpretation&academicYear=20142015)

**Time:** 2020 spring

**Description:** Taught by professor Daniel L. Rubin, mainly about using deep models to deal with medical images. 

**Project Overview:** In a group of two people, we went for a kaggle competition dataset with a x-ray dataset of pneumothorax. The goal was to built a efficient classification model to distinguish patients with pneumothorax from those who didn't. The majority of the project focused on using transfer learning, by fine-tuning models based on state-of-the-art 2D image nets and compare the results.

**Report:** final report of the project is recorded below.
