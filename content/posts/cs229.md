description: My answers to the problem sets for Stanford CS229 course in Spring 2020
---

[CS229 Machine Learning](http://cs229.stanford.edu/) at Stanford has been an inspiring course that built the basics of my machine learning knowledge base. I would like to record my answers to all the problem sets in **Spring 2020** quarter. My answers have two parts:

1. Theory questions: answers were *hand written*, presented in pdf format below. Includes the questions in problem sets;
2. Coding questions: written in python and will be included in my [GitHub  repo](https://github.com/terryli710/CS229).

The answers are not perfect and may contain mistakes, if any readers of this spot any mistakes, feel free to contact and discuss with me either by [posting an issue](https://github.com/terryli710/CS229/issues/new) in my GitHub repo or [emailing me](li.terry710@gmail.com). 

The followings are the answers.
